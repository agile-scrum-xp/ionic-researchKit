Download and import the plugin script.<br />\r\n`<script src=\"lib/ionic-researchkit/ionic-researchkit.js\"></script>`\r\n2. Download and import the plugin stylesheet.<br />\r\n`<link href=\"lib/ionic-researchkit/ionic-researchkit.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\">`\r\n3. Add `ionicResearchKit` to your angular app module dependencies list.<br />\r\n`angular.module('myApp', ['ionicResearchKit']);`\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n1. Add a modal view to your app using [$ionicModal](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/service/$ionicModal/)\r\n2. Add the following to your modal view template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ion-modal-view class=\"irk-modal\">\r\n\r\n  <irk-ordered-tasks>\r\n\t\r\n    <irk-task>\r\n    \t<irk-instruction-step title=\"Your title here.\" text=\"Additional text can go here.\" />\r\n  \t</irk-task>\r\n\r\n\t  <irk-task>\r\n    \t<irk-scale-question-step id=\"data.q2\" title=\"Your question here.\" text=\"Additional text can go here.\" \r\n    \t    min=\"1\" max=\"10\" step=\"1\" value=\"5\" />\r\n  \t</irk-task>\r\n\r\n  \t<irk-task>\r\n    \t<irk-boolean-question-step id=\"data.q2\" title=\"Your question here.\" text=\"Additional text can go here.\" \r\n    \t    trueLabel=\"Yes\" falseLabel=\"No\"/>\r\n\t  </irk-task>\r\n\r\n  </irk-ordered-tasks>\r\n\r\n</ion-modal-view>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Directives\r\n\r\n`<irk-ordered-tasks>` is the equivalent of the `ORKOrderedTask` class in ResearchKit and will encompass one or more `<irk-task>` elements.\r\n\r\n`<irk-task>` is the equivalent of the `ORKTask` class in ResearchKit and will encompass one of the available `<irk-*-step>` elements.\r\n\r\n`<irk-instruction-step>` is the equivalent of the `ORKInstructionStep` class in ResearchKit and includes the `title` and `text` attributes.\r\n\r\n`<irk-scale-question-step>` is the equivalent of the `ORKQuestionStep` and `ORKScaleAnswerFormat` classes in ResearchKit combined and includes the `id`, `title`, `text`, `min`, `max`, `step`, and `value` attributes.\r\n\r\n`<irk-boolean-question-step>` is the equivalent of the `ORKQuestionStep` and `ORKBooleanAnswerFormat` classes in ResearchKit combined and includes the `id`, `title`, `text`, `trueLabel`, and `falseLabel` attributes.\r\n\r\n*These are still a work in progress and I plan to have equivalent directives to all classes in ResearchKit.*\r\n\r\n# Demo\r\n\r\n![App demo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4361804/9769406/dff8d760-56de-11e5-9a08-b6d2f82ad894.gif)\r\n\r\n# Roadmap\r\n\r\n- [x] Task View Controller equivalent \r\n  - [x] Show \"Step x of y\" title\r\n  - [x] Hide Back button on first step\r\n  - [x] Cancel button shows action sheet\r\n  - [x] End Task button (on action sheet) exits task view\r\n  - [x] Change Next button label to Done when on last step\r\n  - [x] Done button exits task view\r\n  - [x] Relaunch should re-init steps\r\n  - [x] Hide Skip button when input is required\r\n  - [x] Enable Next button on input change\r\n- [ ] Results\r\n  - [x] Output results in JSON\r\n    - [ ] Capture all result metadata\r\n  - [ ] Collect results into LocalStorage\r\n- [ ] Survey directives\r\n  - [x] Instruction Step directive\r\n    - [x] Show Get Started button\r\n    - [x] Get Started button shows next step\r\n    - [x] Hide Next and Skip buttons\r\n    - [x] Show optional link\r\n    - [ ] Show optional image\r\n  - [x] Scale Question Step directive\r\n    - [ ] Support step bars\r\n    - [ ] Support vertical orientation\r\n  - [ ] Boolean Question Step directive\r\n    - [ ] Apply radio fix (iOS9)\r\n  - ...\r\n- [ ] Consent directives\r\n- [ ] Active Tasks directives\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-67994808-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
